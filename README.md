**Anchors for Tailwind CSS** is a plugin that brings declarative support for the CSS Anchor Positioning API to Tailwind, allowing you to define and position elements relative to custom anchors. It adds utilities for `anchor-name`, `position-anchor`, `position-area`, `anchor()` and `anchor-size()` expressions.

It also lays the groundwork for using View Transitions to animate any anchored elements, which would require separate JS (for now üëÄ).

## Installation

1. Install the plugin from npm with your preferred package manager:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -D @toolwind/anchors
    ```
2. Then include it in your Tailwind CSS or JS config file:
    
    <details name="install-lang" open><summary><b>CSS (Tailwind CSS v4+)</b></summary>

    ```css
    /* style.css */
    @import "@toolwind/anchors";
    ```

    </details><details name="install-lang"><summary><b>JS (Tailwind CSS v3 compatible)</b></summary>

    ```js
    // tailwind.config.js
    import anchors from "@toolwind/anchors";
    ```

    </details>

## Usage

### Defining an anchor

Use the `anchor/{name}` utility to define an anchor point:

```html
<div class="anchor/my-anchor"></div>
```

The CSS `anchor-name` property requires a dashed ident. For convenience, Anchors for Tailwind CSS automatically converts simple names into dashed idents.

For example, the above utility generates this CSS, prefixed with `--tw-anchor_`:

```css
.anchor\/my-anchor {
  anchor-name: --tw-anchor_my-anchor;
}
```

If you need to use a specific dashed ident for an anchor name, the plugin will respect and preserve the original name if it encounters an ident that is already dashed.

```html
<div class="anchor/--my-anchor"></div>
```

This utility also accepts arbitrary values, so if you want to pass a name via a CSS variable, you can do so using the square bracket syntax, like this:

```html
<div class="[--custom-property:--my-anchor]">
  <div class="anchor/[var(--custom-property)]"></div>
</div>
```

üöß Note that names passed via a custom property (square bracket syntax) resolves to a dashed ident already, as it's not possible for a plugin to read and manipulate runtime values.

### Positioning relative to an anchor

Once an anchor has been defined, you can anchor other elements to it.

Use `anchored/{name}` to attach an element to an anchor:

```html
<div class="anchored/my-anchor"></div>
```

Use `anchored-{side}` to specify the position area of the anchored element. For example, `anchored-top-center` will position the element at the top center of its anchor, touching the anchored element:

```html
<div class="anchored-top-center"></div>
```

Or, put both together for shorthand syntax:

```html
<div class="anchored-top-center/my-anchor"></div>
```

This sets:

```css
position-anchor: --tw-anchor_my-anchor;
position-area: top center;
position: absolute;
view-transition-name: --tw-anchor-view-transition-313d192p322r2w3336;
/* ‚òùÔ∏è View Transition-ready, with encoded view-transition-name */
```

Both the `position` and `view-transition-name` are applied with zero specificity (via `:where()`), making them easy to overwrite with other values, if you choose. As a rule of thumb, anchored elements must use absolute or fixed positioning. This plugin defaults to `absolute` positioning, but you can add `fixed` to use fixed positioning instead.

This plugin strives to strike a balance between abstracting away the complexity of the CSS Anchor Positioning API and empowering developers to fully leverage it.

## Supported Utilities

#### `anchor/{name}`

Sets `anchor-name: --tw-anchor_{name}`

#### `anchored/{name}`

Sets:
- `position-anchor: --tw-anchor_{name}`
- `view-transition-name` (automatically generated per anchor)

#### `anchor-{position}`

Sets `position-area`. Examples:

- `anchor-top-center` ‚Üí `top center`
- `anchor-bottom-span-left`
- `anchor-top-right`, etc.

#### `{top|right|bottom|left|inset}-anchor-{side}-{offset}/{name?}`

Generates directional offset using `anchor()`:

```html
<div class="top-anchor-bottom"></div>
```

Results in:

```css
top: anchor(bottom);
```

With offset support:

```html
<div class="top-anchor-bottom-4"></div>
```

```css
top: calc(anchor(bottom) + 1rem); // assuming 4 = theme('spacing.4')
```

#### `{w|h}-anchor{-size?}/{name?}]`

Size utilities using `anchor-size()`:

- **Omitting the anchor size (i.e. default size/dimension)**

  `w-anchor` ‚Üí `width: anchor-size(width)` 
  If the `{size}` is omitted, the dimension defaults to the `<anchor-size>` keyterm that matches the axis of the property in which the function is included. For example, `width: anchor-size();` is equivalent to `width: anchor-size(width);`. (source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor-size#anchor-size))
- **Declaring the anchor-size (width/height/etc.) to use as a length**

  `w-anchor-height` ‚Üí `width: anchor-size(height)`
- **Setting/omitting the anchor name**

  * `w-anchor` ‚Üí `width: anchor-size(width)` 
  * `w-anchor/--name` ‚Üí `width: anchor-size(--name width)` 
  * `w-anchor/name` ‚Üí `width: anchor-size(--tw-anchor_name width)` 

  Specifying an `<anchor-name>` inside an `anchor-size()` function neither associates nor tethers an element to an anchor; it only defines which anchor the element's property values should be set relative to. (source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor-size#anchor-size))

## View Transition API Integration

Every `anchored/{name}` class includes a `view-transition-name`, making your anchored elements animatable with `document.startViewTransition()`:

```js
document.startViewTransition(() => {
  el.classList.remove('anchor-top-left')
  el.classList.add('anchor-bottom-right')
})
```

This animates position shifts smoothly using the browser-native View Transitions API.

## Why use Anchors for Tailwind CSS? ü§î

- Declarative anchor positioning with Tailwind utility syntax
- Full support for native anchor-related CSS properties and functions
- Easy offset control via `calc(anchor(...) + theme spacing)` _(under the hood)_
- Built-in support for View Transitions
- Fully JIT-compatible, no runtime required
